# Hello world! üëã

We are [SPACERS](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/track-the-iss/teams/spacers-2/project),
a team that participates in the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/) in Barcelona, Spain.
We developed an ISS tracker that shows its current position in 3D, and if you have VR glasses you can
deep dive into the station without having to travel to space!

You can find the project in the following url: https://isslocator.earth/

## üèîÔ∏è Challenge

Among [all the challenges](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/) for this edition, we decided to choose the challenge to
[track the International Space Station in 3D](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/track-the-iss/details)
as we think that this a very useful, attractive and fun way to display the information that usually doesn't visually impact on youth,
making this way a new way to try to engage them on the space topic. 

## üë• Team

Despite the project was first developed by [Alejandro Acho](https://github.com/Alejandroacho), [Claudia Di Pietro](https://github.com/claudiadipietro)
and [Adam Rkouni](https://github.com/adam-53-r), we want to invite you to collaborate if you want to, for that you can go to the
[repo of the app](https://github.com/SPACERS-NASA-Space-Apps-Barcelona/web-app), open an issue or pull request, and we will be happy to make
this project bigger.

## üì∞ News

We are proud to announce that we were the winners of the local competition, and we are going to represent Barcelona in the
global competition :tada:.
